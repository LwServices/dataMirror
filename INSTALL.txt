dataMirror v0.1

Why? Modx Revo saves Chunks, Templates, Resources, Snippets in the Database.
This is a great feature but at this point you get a problem when you used
to use a IDE like Coda, Dreamweaver ...

This Plugin solves this Problem.

Install:

Create Directories:

cd <base_path>
mkdir assets/mirror/resources
mkdir assets/mirror/chunks
mkdir assets/mirror/snippets
mkdir assets/mirror/templates

Install Plugin:
- download datamirrow-0.1-beta1.transport.zip and move to core/packages 
- go to Package Management
- add new package
- search Localy
- install package

Use:
go to modx manager edit something (chunk for example) and save.
after you saved it you should see a file in assets/mirror/chunks
for <id>-<name>.html (example 15-myChunk.html)

now edit it in your editor the file.
you save
you refresh the page (this will be copy the file to database)


Production:
you should remove all mirror files and deactivate this plugin.
